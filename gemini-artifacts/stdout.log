了解しました。競技プログラミングライブラリのドキュメント改善タスクを開始します。`md/Graph/general_matching.md`が選択されました。関連ファイルの調査を開始します。OK, `src/Graph/general_matching.hpp` exists. Now finding its includes in `test/`.Okay, I've identified the relevant files: the document, the source code, and the test code. I'll start by reading one of each to find areas for improvement in the documentation.Okay, source code next.Okay, I'll read the test code. `test/yosupo/general_matching.test.cpp` seems like a good place to start.After reviewing the documentation, source, and test code, I've identified several areas for improvement. The function name is wrong in the documentation (`generate_matching` vs. `general_matching`), which is a critical error. I'll correct this, clarify the argument and return value descriptions, remove the informal "fast" from the complexity analysis, and add a minimal code example based on the test cases. I will apply these fixes to `md/Graph/general_matching.md`.I've reviewed the file and will update it. I'll correct the function name to `general_matching`, clarify the argument and return value descriptions, remove the unnecessary "fast" from the complexity, and add a sample code block based on the yosupo test.Doc fixed. Now, write `TARGET_FILE` and `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY` to `GITHUB_ENV`. `TARGET_FILE` is `md/Graph/general_matching.md`, `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY` is "Corrected function name, expanded description, and added code example." Executing.Task complete. I improved `md/Graph/general_matching.md` by correcting the function name to `general_matching` for accuracy, adding detailed argument/return value descriptions for completeness, and updating the overall explanation with a code example for readability. `TARGET_FILE` and `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY` are set.
